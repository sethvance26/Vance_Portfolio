              <p>WorkDay scheduler uses Moment.js to give user the current time and date, and alters the color of each line depending 
                on the current hour within a typical 9 to 5 workday. The User can also write in notes for each hour which will be stored in the
                user's Local Storage and remain on the page. Jquery and conditional statements were also applied in this project.

              <h4> <a href="https://github.com/sethvance26/Employee-Tracker" class="whiteText">MySql Employee Tracker</h4>
              <p> Employee Tracker uses MySql to architect and build a solution for managing a potential company's employees 
                using node, inquirer, and mySQL. In simple terms, this application builds a Content Management System, so that 
                non-developers can view and interact with employee information within the database. 
                This way you can add Employees, Departments, and Roles, view the existing ones in the database, 
                and update roles for existing employees' as well. We were given no starter code this week, so everything was coded from scratch!</p>
