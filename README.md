#### Zero to Hero

    I started out this project by taking the code from my first ever Portfolio project.
    The original project had some applicable information, and working URL's that I could still use!
    
     From there, I decided which framework I wanted to use. 
     We weren't allowed to use the default Bootstrap theme, so I just used Foundation as my CSS framework instead.
     Foundation enabled me to use existing css styles to style social media icons, a navbar, and even cards in a nice mobile layout!

     Next, I began plugging in some images and updated information into these styled foundation cards, 
     and created 3 different HTML pages for each "section" of my portfoilio website. 
     Each page contains different information. An about me page, a contact information page, 
     and previous works page. These can all be navigated to and from each other within the top header of each page. 
     Once I plugged in each URL for the social media icons and previous works, all the links and icons were fully functional! 
     * Note * 
     In the previous works section, you can navigate to each individual Repo by clicking on the name of each previous work. 


     Lastly, I had to add more styling as well with media queries in order to make the page look good on Desktop and be responsive for other viewports. 

     Once the code side was finished and comments were added, we were instructed to polish up our Github and LinkedIn profiles.
